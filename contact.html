        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Joey - I am an Automation & Embedded Systems Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy working in embedded systems because it combines my love of problem-solving with the satisfaction of seeing tangible results. There is something uniquely rewarding about designing a system, troubleshooting each step, and ultimately watching hardware and software come together to create something that works in the real world. Beyond enjoyment, I've found that I have a natural aptitude for this field — breaking down complex problems into smaller, solvable pieces and building reliable systems that operate seamlessly.</p>
        <p>In my professional work, I've had the opportunity to design and automate advanced coating chambers used in aerospace manufacturing. These projects required integrating PLCs, SCADA systems, microcontrollers, and custom automation logic to coordinate power supplies, sensors, vacuum gauges, and more into a cohesive, recipe-driven process. The chambers I've automated are now running daily production for clients such as SpaceX, Chromalloy, and Raytheon, saving operators hours of manual oversight and ensuring reliable, repeatable results. Building systems at this scale has taught me how to balance precision engineering with practical implementation.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I hope to continue growing as an embedded systems engineer by working with collaborative teams where knowledge-sharing and mentorship are valued. I want to keep pushing myself to learn new tools, improve my technical skillset, and take on projects that challenge me in both design and implementation. Most of all, I'm motivated by the opportunity to contribute to systems that make a real impact, while working alongside people who are as passionate about engineering as I am.</p>

          My interest for Embedded systems began in senior year of high school in my electronics class. For our final project we were supposed to use a combination of IC's with logic gates, push buttons, and LED's on a breadboard to make something of your choice. I decided to make a 2-player "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game where the corresponding LED would light up if you won. I soon found out while making this that my plan was much more complicated than I thought and it took me a week of working on my project at lunch to finally get it to work. It turned out that my project was way overkill for that particular class, I could've gotten an A with much less work; most people just made a flasher or something, but it was the most determined I have ever been in a school project for some reason. This system of trial and error while learning is what made me become an automated systems engineer.

        I discovered a love of problem solving taking an elective class in high school called "Electronics." For my final project, I decided to make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game using labeled push-buttons to simulate each player's choice and an RGB LED to indicate player 1 wins, player 2 wins, or a tie. I knew that the complexity of my project was overkill for an elective class that most people took as a throw-away class; however, I was determined to get my project to work. For my entire last week of senior year, I spent my lunch break in the electronics room by myself struggling to get my project to work.

          What I love about Embedded Systems Engineering is starting in a problem space where nothing makes sense and solving one sub-problem at a time until there are no problems left. Additionally, it gives you the unique opportunity to take an esoteric idea and
